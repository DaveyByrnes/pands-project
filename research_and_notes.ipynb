I consulted the internet, finding [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp) article from W3Schools, however it didn't provide everything I felt was necessary - getting the dataframe to print cleanly. I consulted ChatGPT, and you can see the query and aid it provided [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/681a75f8-f5a4-8010-b466-27cac545d09c)."
