# pands-project

## **Introduction**

Hi there, I'm David - and you're currently reading my README.md file regarding my pands-project for 2025, centered around the Iris dataset.

**The Iris Dataset**

The Iris Dataset is a famous dataset made by Ronald Fisher in 1936, often used as an example dataset for stastical analysis projects such as this one! I will be tackling this project based on the following perameters:

- [ ] Research the dataset online and write a summary about it in your README.
- [x] Download the dataset and add it to your repository.
- [ ] Write a program called analysis.py that:
  - [x] Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
  - [x] Saves a histogram of each variable to .png files
  - [x] Outputs a scatter plot of each variables
  - [ ] Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.

I will also produce a Jupyter notebook containing extra comments about the process and my code that is not mentioned here. We'll start at the beginning.
